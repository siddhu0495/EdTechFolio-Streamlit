However, the specific instruction to limit it to 100 words creates a direct conflict.\n\nCrucially, the query also states \"Text: summarize the text in 100 words,\" which appears to be a placeholder or error rather than an actual text to summarize. There is **no substantive content provided** for summarization. The core issue is the contradictory requirements: the instruction for length (\"Long\") clashes with the strict word count limit (\"100 words\"), and the essential element\u2014a text to summarize\u2014is missing entirely. To fulfill the request accurately, the text must be provided first, and the conflicting length specifications must be resolved. Without the text, any summary would be impossible. The primary problem is the impossible dual instruction: both \"long\" and \"exactly 100 words\" cannot be satisfied simultaneously for a meaningful summary."
